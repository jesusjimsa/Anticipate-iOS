# Anticipate: Countdown Widgets
Create countdowns for your events using your own photos and add them as widgets to your home screen to be able to quickly see them as the important date approaches. You can create as many countdowns as you want completely for free by just adding a title, a date and a photo from your gallery.

Whether you're counting down to a vacation, birthday, wedding, graduation, or any special moment, personalize each countdown with meaningful images that remind you what you're looking forward to. The beautiful widget design seamlessly integrates with your home screen aesthetic while keeping your upcoming events front and center.

Track multiple events simultaneously and never miss an important date again. The app automatically updates your countdown each day, showing you exactly how many days remain until your special moment arrives. Simple, elegant, and completely free.
